By Lucevar

Distributes the horns and antler's from RuffinVangarr's Fashionwind - MWSE Horns and Antlers to some of the Bosmer NPCs. See the NPC changelog file in /docs for more details about which NPCs have been changed.

* NOD - Core.esp

Compatibility: 
Should be compatible with pretty much anything, including the original Fashionwind esp. The Fashionwind original esp will add an NPC with some unique dialogue who you can buy the horns from for your own character.

Credits:
RuffinVangarr and Safebox for creating Onion and Fashionwind

Permissions:
Anything that I've done (in this case, just distributed the horns to NPCs), feel free to use as you please, as long as you abide by the permissions and requirements of the modders whose assets I've used.
