* NOD - Core.esm

Compatibility: 
Should be compatible with pretty much anything, including the original Fashionwind esp. 

Credits:
RuffinVangarr and Safebox for creating Onion and Fashionwind
NullCascade and Melchior Dahrk for the Mage Robes code which I adapted to make the distribution scripts

Permissions:
Anything that I've done (in this case, just distributed the items to NPCs), feel free to use as you please, as long as you abide by the permissions and requirements of the modders whose assets I've used.
