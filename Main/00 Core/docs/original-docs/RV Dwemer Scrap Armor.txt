Dwemer Scrap Armor

Tired of hauling tons of worthless dwemer junk around, some crafty smugglers have decided to put it to use, forging it into a modest set of medium armor.
This new set was added to leveled lists so you it can be found anywhere you'd typically find armor within a bandit cave or smugglers den.

If I have made any mistakes or you have any suggestions please let me know.

This mod is also a resource which you are welcome to use as you please, credit is unnecessary though it is appreciated.
