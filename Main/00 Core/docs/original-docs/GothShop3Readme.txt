Morrowind
Slof's Goth Shop
Slof's Goth Shop Add-On. It will work best with, and is designed for Better Bodies 2.2. Clipping may occur on other body types.


==============================================
ABOUT THIS MOD:
===============================================
There are so many female clothing mods out there, but very few for the guys, so I decided to do a few things for them, since my world really revolves around males. I can't compete with the excellent female clothing modders (I don't have much sense of female fashion, despite being female!), so I'm sticking to stuff I like to see men in! I will probably do clothing and armour variations of the same outfits so they can be mixed and matched. I did these primarily for myself and my vampire character Basil, so most of the armoured stuff will be light and it's all goth stuff.

Just on the northern outskirts of Vos, a reclusive pale-skinned altmer by the name of Mr Lee has opened a little shop that caters for gentlemen of a darker persuasion. Named after his pet guar, Nigel, The Black Guar sells a large range of goth style clothing for men only, from fetish-wear to stylish trenchcoats. Mr Lee also sells an exclusive range of snakeskin separates that mix'n'match. He also has a selection of paintings in two sizes, all of my vampire characters and a few shiny knick-knacks for sale. As the enigmatic Mr Lee is a vampire catering specifically for vampires, it makes sense that he only opens at night; the shop is closed during the day and the lock is unpickable. Despite his vampirism, he is happy to sell to any customers, mortal or vampire - he doesn't even care what clan the vampiric customer is. Money is money, after all!

I've made the stuff in the shop unstealable - customers can see what he has on offer but can't pick it up. The only way to steal from him is to get through into his back room - no easy task either! If he catches you trying to pick his door lock, prepare to be drained dry!

New in v1.2:

A selection of 13 Robin Hood style hats that fit men and women
Proper spiked bracers and boots in several leathers with gold and silver spikes - also work on male and female
Some new men-only outfits inspired from my own dreams
Piercings and necklaces fixed so they work on companions and slaves - piercings now available in gold as well
The positional script is now bug-free and things should stay in whatever position they are left in, even when starting up the game again
Fixed a bug in the feather spell on the pouches and sporrans that could affect inventory encumberance
Features new fancy shirts from modders' resources by Truthsnark and Elynda - I liked them so much I included them. I've renamed ID's and filenames to avoid conflicts
Free-standing tabletop picture frames made by Astion
Christopher Lee now compatible with Scent of Blood - he should smell like an Aundae!

*Note for Scent of Blood users: ScentOfBlood must load after the Goth Shop, else SOB is broken. This can be timestamped either with Wrye Mash, or using the CS. There is no effect if Scent of Blood is not in use.

New in v1.1:

All the paintings sold in the shop are now just one size - the new script has a lot more options, including the ability to scale them up or down to suit where the player wants to hang them. Hopefully this new script is free of the bug some players have reported, where the paintings would have moved when starting a new game. I'm no scripter, and had no idea where the bug was or how to fix it, so I'm trying a different one.

Christopher Lee is now a unique race (non-playable), with his own textures. His face is based roughly on a pic of a very young real Chistopher Lee as Dracula. Mr Lee is one of my greatest heroes of the silver screen, and this mod is kind of a tribute to him. The changes don't affect any other high elf vampires.

Some of the clothing is very revealing and designed to be fun fetish wear. I advise caution when buying clothing - some of it reveals a lot more than it covers! Some of it will fit female characters, but much of it won't. I make clothing for males mostly! All the boots, shoes, gloves,wigs, necklaces, collars, loincloths, skirts, and some pants, will work with female characters, shirts, coats, robes, tattoos and piercings won't.

I've replaced the rotating crystal knot with a puzzle box based on the one in the Hellraiser movies. Lee also sells three of these, but unlike the rest of his stuff, they don't respawn in his inventory. They don't do anything weird like sending you to Hell, they are just ornamental!

The fishnet pants are now buyable - I forgot to include them in his stock the first time around! I've also updated some meshes and textures, so allow these to overwrite when it asks.

===============================================
INSTALLATION:
===============================================
This mod should consist of:
GothShopAddonReadme.txt
Slof's Goth Shop 1.1.esp
icons folder
meshes folder
textures folder

Just drag all these (minus the readme) onto the data files folder in your Morrowind directory and they will go where they are meant to. All the files are nested inside folders marked 'AS' - KEEP THESE INTACT - the game knows to look there for them.

Paths for the folders are as follows:
Icons: data files/icons/AS
Meshes: data files/meshes/AS
Textures: data files/textures/AS

If Slof's Goth Shop 1.1.esp is in use, simply overwrite with this version.

Updating from Slof's Goth Shop to 1.1:
Make sure to uncheck Slof's Goth Shop.esp and check Slof's Goth Shop 1.1.esp - don't have both checked or the doubling will be horrendous! Best results will be from keeping a clean save game file, but there may still be some oddness in the shop displays. This is due to 'dirty' saves and nothing I can do about that.

The most sure way to avoid doubling, is to uncheck the old Slof's Goth Shop.esp, then save out a new save game, then check the new version. The downside to this is that you will lose any gear you've already bought. A way around this that I came up with was to sell everything, then save, disable the mod, save again, and at least you have your money back! Either way, Mr Lee's inventory is unaffected - everything is available without a problem.

===============================================
KNOWN ISSUES OR BUGS:
===============================================
There might be some minor clipping and shirts probably won't work with Bethesda boots due to how the body slots are used for BB clothing. Some alpha-channelled clothing will disappear underwater if viewed from above. This is to do with the alpha-channels and nothing much I can do about that! The easy solution is: take your clothes off to go swimming! ;)

There is also some slight clipping at the top of the leg on the pants that show parts of the leg through. Again, this is a mesh issue and I can't avoid that. Best just to ignore it unless I can find a newer mesh or get it fixed. All of this stuff is male only - some of it can be worn by females, but none of it is of a feminine shape and some items will cause major clipping on a woman - bits of her would stick out in very strange places!

There will be a certain amount of experimentation with mixing and matching clothes; some things work together and some don't. This is down to the way I've had to use body slots. I've done my best to make most things work together.

Sometimes the mannequin heads spin when you enter the shop. I've never figured out why they do this, it's just one of those odd little things!

These textures are very large, and may cause a framerate hit on lower-end computers. I could have made them smaller, but at the sacrifice of quality. I went for quality. :)

===============================================
INCOMPATIBILITIES & SAVED GAME WARNINGS:
===============================================
Always make sure that you back up your existing savegame file before use.

There are no known incompatabilities that I know of, apart from the Bethesda boots thing - it's just a basic clothing mod.

This has been cleaned with TESAME

I don't really mind if any of this is used for or in other mods, but it's nice to be asked (I don't often say no!), and please give credit to me and the mesh-makers where it is due. Please ask me before uploading it anywhere so I can make sure the correct version is used and not an out of date one.
