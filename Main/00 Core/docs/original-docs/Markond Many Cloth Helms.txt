Adds eleven recolours of the scarfs from Axeljk's Cloth Helms mod for sale at:

Seyda Neen, Arille's Tradehouse
Ald-Ruhn, Tiras Sadus: General Merchandise
Balmora, Ravirr: Trader.

Comes in red, orange, yellow, green, light blue, deep blue, purple, rose, black, grey, and the original brown.

Stats and prices are identical to the original mod.
Cosmetic Overrides might be a good choice for those who don't want to sacrifice style for function and/or not getting stabbed in the face by bandits.

Compatibility

Should work with almost any body, head or hair mod. Might be some minor clipping with some longer hair styles. Uses the neck body slot but functions as a helmet, which I believe some beast race mods also make use of.

There is now a Wares aware version by Danae and QwertyQuit. Npcs of all races have a chance of having a scarf, it should show up fairly evenly in merchant inventories, and members of the Great Houses, the Temple and the Ashlanders have a chance of wearing an appropriate faction colour.

And now there's a Wares and DRIP version, thank you again Danae.
