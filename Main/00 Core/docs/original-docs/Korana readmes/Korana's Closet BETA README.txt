1.  What is this?  

Korana's closet is a clothing store that contains:

-Modified HG Robe Set 4 retextured robes.  The Robes have been modified to fit
 Better Bodies 2.0 Specifically.  A few with custom capes to fit the robes 
 (also made by Junkmail)
-A pair of fishnet nylong pants with shorts attached.
-Sandals and boots for both Male and Females (these items have 2 each).  Also 
 made by Junkmail for Better Bodies 2.0
-3 New sheilds and a retextured staff
-6 Dresses using Neuman's Tight Dress Mesh for Better Bodies 2.0
-12 tapestries
-2 paintings
-There is one Imperial Female BB Mannequin and one Dark Elf BB Mannequin.  The 
meshes and textures for these are not included.  You WILL need to obtain the 
required mod for these to work.
-A moveable and placable "wrought iron and copper" fire place screen.
-A Few other household items.
-All the non enchanted armor from Morrowind and Tribunal are also sold....at their 
 original prices.
-Gorg's Necklaces are also all sold here in one location.  Please see requirements.

Somewhere, if your really dillagent about where you look...is a house key (see below 
for spoilers).Underneath the shop is a small house designed for the player's brief 
enjoyment. It contains a storage room with labeled container, a kitchen, a bedroom, 
nd a bathroom "grotto" as I like to call it.  

Where is the Store located?

Korana's Closet is located just off of Ebonheart's South Bridge.  The Store can be 
seen from the docks.

2.  Requirements

-Better Bodies 2.0 is required for this mod to work for the mannequins.  However, the
 robes MIGHT work with Smoother Bodies.  However, they will NOT work with the original
 bethesda bodies...unless a nude mod is used.  I cannot and will not attest to any ill
 fighting or clipping issues that arise without the specified version of better bodies
 being in use.

  Better Bodies can be obtained here:  
          
                         http://www.psychodogstudios.net/betterbodies/downloads.php

However, they do ask that you do not contact them for any issues with this mod. Thank you!


-Gorg's Necklace Pack is also required for the mod.  In the final release I will include
 a non necklace pack requirement.  In the meantime, you can obtain the necklace pack here:

-You WILL need the expansion, Tribunal.  However, Bloodmoon is not needed.

3.  Installation

1.  Icons-
	the folders "KO" and "KO_Junk" should be placed in your Morrowind/Datafiles/Icon
        directory

2.  Meshes-
        the folders "KO", "KO_Heads", "KO_Junk", and "KO_Robes" should be placed in your
        Morrowind/DataFiles/Meshes directory

3.  Textures-
         the textures should be placed loose in your Morrowind/Datafiles/Textures directory


The esp "Korana's Closet" should be placed in your Morrowind/Data Files directory
   

Feel free to toss this readme (although with fear of death if I get a PM covering something
in this readme!)

((For the final version I hope to have an installer created to avoid the confusion with all
  the files...sorry))
*****************************************************************************************

4. Known Issues-

   WELL ITS A BETA FOR A REASON:
	
	- Minor Clipping issues with the clothing.
	- !!The robes have clipping issues with some of Bethesda's original heads.  However, I 
          havn't come across any clipping issues with non Bethesda head meshes.  Please
          contact me when some are found.  (to see the clipping issue, equip one of the
          robes on the Imperial Mannequin).!!
	- The mannequins will not equip the necklaces.
	- All of the items look "odd" on your character display in your inventory. I do not 
          believe it is fixable.
	- You cannot wear a necklace and still have a cape on the robes which have capes.  
          If you wish to have the cape shown you will need to unequip the necklace.
	- The tight dresses take up an ankle slot.  Wearing some boots or shoes with them will
          cause the dresses to disappear.  However, the boots and sandals sold here are 
          compatable.
	- There will be minor clipping issues/coloring issues with the necklaces.
	- The First Person arms are not showing up...I'm working on what might be causing the 
          issue.
