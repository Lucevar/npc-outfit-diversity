This mod is obviously inspired by the ebony warrior from skyrim, a end/post game final challenge kind of opponent who puts everything you learned throughout the game to the test. Or at least that's how it should be, morrowind's combat system doesn't exactly allow for much intricacy in epic duels so he's essentially just a normal NPC with a lot of health and damage. but hey, at least he's wearing some pretty cool looking armor right?

This was mostly made to implement my custom made Dunmer Ebony Armor in a satisfying way.

Please let me know if there are any bugs or whatever and I'll do my best to fix them up.
