1. Installation

Unzip "KRS_VG_v2.1.rar" and extract the "Data Files" folder to your 
"The Elder Scrolls III" directory, or whichever directory has your
"Data Files" folder in it. A message box will appear, informing you
that the folder is of the same name and may overwrite some files.
Say "Yes" to this message box and continue. You will receive similar
messages regarding "Texture", "Meshes" and "Icons" folders- agree to
these individually, or simply hit "Yes to all"

If these message boxes DO NOT appear, then you have done something
wrong and should check your directories. Make sure that you are
unzipping/extracting all files to your "The Elder Scrolls III" directory,
and NOT into your "Data Files" folder. If this happens, you will now
have a "Data Files" folder INSIDE your original folder (of the same
name). Simply select that folder, press CTRL and X (which will "cut"
the folder) and back out of your directory until the "Data Files" 
folder appears. Then hit CTRL and V to paste, and you should receive
the messages described above.

Since the file is .RAR, WinACE users may experience errors in trying
to access the archive.

2. Modifications

-2.1b update: Seems I forgot to include some reflection maps on a couple
of items. Minor fix - if your game was crashing when trying to use the
shield or Void Scythe, this little tweak should fix it.

-2.1a update: Some minor ESP fixes - corrected the missing icon on the
white void shirt, some scripting and dialogue issues with the two quests,
and some minor adjustments with the BB void skirts.

-This mod adds several armor and clothing sets based on the "Void" color
scheme I devised. Sets include, in no particular order:
Light, Medium, & Heavy Void Armor
Void Assassin Armor
White Void Armor
Common & Expensive Void Clothing
BB Common, Expensive, & Exquisite Void Clothing
Void Weapons
Misc. Void Items
Certain items can be purchased in different locations.

-In Sadrith Mora, you may find the armorer Anruin. He has several crates of
the more basic armors for sale, as well as some weapons. The Void Consolate
is not on the best of terms with House Telvanni, so some persuasion might be
needed.

-In the Great Bazaar of Mournhold, the trader Artanis Eston has set himself
up in one of the unused merchant carts, and wears Void Gear in additon to
selling it. He provides higher-level armors and more extravagant clothing.

-A tavern/cornerclub can be found in the sewers below the Great Bazaar. At
night, Artanis prefers this to the cold stones of the Bazaar. And if you
get on his good side, he might let you in on a few of the Void Consolate's
little secrets...

-Certain artifacts were placed unobtrusively in a couple cells. Check the
SPOILERS file if you must, but it's more fun to do the quests...

**CAUTION TO ALD INDORIL USERS: The "Chancellor's Chalice" is located in
the Great Bazaar sewers, perilously close to the entrance to the Ald Indoril
sewers. Conflicts unknown- use caution and backup your saved games before
enabling.

**PLEASE REPORT ALL BUGS TO ME. CONTACT INFO AT THE BOTTOM.**

3. Saved Games

With the exceptions of the conflicts noted above, this plugin should be 100% safe
with all saved games. If you save your game after loading this plugin, and thereafter
remove the .ESP, you may receive error messages, especially if you're wearing
Void Gear.

All retexturing done by me, Kieve. Some Tribunal meshes were used, so unlike
my past releases, this mod requires Tribunal to run. Void Gear may be 
redistributed free of charge for use in any mod, provided this text file goes with it.
Obviously, I am not responsible for any changes you make to the files.
Should you make a change for public release, please notify me via e-mail or
