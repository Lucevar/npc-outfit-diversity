1. DESCRIPTION
===============
The goal of this mod is to make dreamers more diverse (and creepier!) and also to make raiding 6th House bases a bit more challenging: no more harmless naked level 1 NPCs armed only with sticks!

There are 3 types of dreamers now:

1) Type A - No corprus or initial stage of corprus:
These are just ordinary people, enslaved by Dagoth's dreams: commoners, noblemen, traders, priests, herders, etc. They don't have any advanced military or magical training so they aren't a threat to a skilled adventurer. 
These dreaers are low-leveled (1-5), clad in simple or torn clothes, with varied stats and abilities, armed with simple weapons and an occasional magical trinket or throwing weapon. You can't catch blight diseases from them. They have coughing or - rarely - praying animations from Animated Morrowind by Arcimaestro Antares.
Usually you won't meet Type A beyond the Ghostfence: they aren't tough enough to survive the journey to the Red Mountain or to endure its climate.

2) Type B - Advanced stage of corprus:
Visible signs of the decease, wounds, bandages (corprus has reached the stage when dreamers cut off pieces of flesh from themselves). 
Corprus has changed them and lowered their intelligence so they aren't able to cast spells and can't remember how to use enchanted objects anymore, but it is compensated by higher melee skills. Their level is 5-10. They can give you a blight disease.
I used for them dreamers' faces by Soti (I intentionally didn't use Soti's 3-eyed faces: they are awesome but I think only Dagoth Ur and his brothers should have the 3rd eye as a sign of their transcendent nature). Type B have long claws which they use to tear off pieces of corprus meat from themselves. 
Corprus makes them tough and allows them to survive beyond the Ghostfence, so they can be found in all major 6th House Citadels.

Most of them have dreamers' A and B animations from Animated Morrowind by Arcimaestro Antares. Workers in Akulakhan's Chamber have miner's animation from Animated Morrowind by Arcimaestro Antares.

3) Type C - mini-bosses:
There are only few of them, in some major 6th House bases. Concerning their corprus stage, they are closer to Type A, but the difference is that they are not some ordinary people enslaved by Sharmat's dreams, but skilled sorcerers who were aware of their House Dagoth lineage and willingly joined the 6th House. Thus they became favored by Dagoth Ur, and he gave them more power and more control over corprus. You'll recognize them easily - they wear new 6th House Armored Robe outfit.

4) Type D - Dreamer Warriors:
They will stand outside guarding some 6th House bases. 
Type D will appear only after Ilunibi quest, since: 1 - at this point the player is already supposed to know about the existence of the 6th House bases; 2 - the 6th House has increased it's influence. However, most of the 6th House bases are supposed to be secret. So I added warriors only to the bases' entrances in Ashland, where the 6th House can operate more freely. 
All Type D will disappear after Dagoth's death.  

I've incorporated into this mod wonderful Dagoth Bonemold armor by Petiboy. Now Dagoth Bonemold is worn by Dreamer Warriors, by the Dreamer guard in Mamaea, and, if you use DNGDR compatibility patch, then dreamer guards added by DNGDR will also wear this armor. I didn't change locations of armor pieces: you'll still be able to find them in various 6th House bases, same as in the original mod.

2. Requirements
===============
- Better Bodies (or Robert's male bodies: I'm using them and they seem to work fine with this mod)

From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files and check the box next to *.esp


=====================
4. PLAYING THE PLUGIN
=====================
DreamersExpansion.ESP - basic version.

DreamersExpansion+GHD_patch.ESP - patch for Madgod's Great House Dagoth (contains modified CalmCorprus script).

============================
6. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ERRORS
============================
This mod will obviously conflict with any other mod that modifies dreamers. Conflicts with mods that change Akulakhan's Chamber are also possible.

New dreamers are added into some of 6th House leveled lists so if you have other mods which modify these lists, don't forget to use a leveled list merging utility.

PB_Dagoth_Bonemold by Petiboy and Dreamer's Faces by SoTi are incorporated into this mod. Using them together may cause conflicts or doubling issues (though that's unlikely).
