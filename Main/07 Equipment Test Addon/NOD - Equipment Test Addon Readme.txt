Adds everything from NOD v1 and a whole bunch (but not everything) from OAAB and TD to new merchants in Ranosa Gilvayn's shop in Suran. 

Testing purposes only, I STRONGLY recommend against using this for a real game. You can also use it to buy the unique sets which aren't available except by killing their wearers.

NOTE: Just because the test npcs are selling it DOES NOT mean I've given it to an NPC.
