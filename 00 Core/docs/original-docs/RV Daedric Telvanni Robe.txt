This mod adds a Daedric Telvanni robe the game.

you can find it in Tel Fyr in Divayth's drawers.

v2 UPDATE!!!!!
I have completely remade the robe model with vastly improved textures and Uvs, as this one has no armoring I have taken out the cuirass version (I have something coming in the future for medium armor daedric things)


Credits:
Merlod - for creating the midjourny textures I used for this robe
Antares - for his drakes pride robe which I partially used to make this.
