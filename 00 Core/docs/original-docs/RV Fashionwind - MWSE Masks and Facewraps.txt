This mod adds cosmetic Facemasks that can be worn without hiding your hair or taking up a helmet slot thanks to a script made by the talented Safebox.

you can purchase them from a new masked npc in the south wall cornerclub in balmora.
VERY IMPORTANT NOTES!!!!
-This mod requires the MWSE Onion layers mod as a framework, which itself requires MWSE, you can get them here: Onion - Layered Headwear and Facial Wearï»¿ and MGE XE



SOMEWHAT LESS IMPORTANT NOTES!
-This mod is doesn't officially support beast races; they might work for some heads but not for others because of the wildly variant shape of beast heads.
-This mod also may have clipping if you use a mod for different heads, however you are able to alter the exact positioning of the masks by race in the main.lua file, if you wish to create a compatibility file for a specific head mod I can host it here if you like.
-If you use a custom race you can add it to the main.lua file and alter the exact positioning of the models if the default position does not suit.
-This is an MWSE mod so it wont work with openmw



Special thanks to:
Safebox for his support and making the onion framework
R-zero for his ashmask model and for mask ideas.
