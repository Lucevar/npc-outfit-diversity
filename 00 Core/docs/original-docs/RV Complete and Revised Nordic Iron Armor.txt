This mod adds the complete set of Nordic Iron armor to the game, and contains slightly improved versions of the vanilla pieces. You can find them in the appropriate leveled lists.

there's also an optional version with a skirt if you want it.

and that's it really.

All of my mods free for anyone to use as a resource for what ever you want and free for anyone to translate and host on other sites, as long as you give credit.

If I've made a mistake of some kind, please let me know and I'll do my best to solve it.
