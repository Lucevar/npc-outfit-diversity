1.  What is this?
 

Dawn is a specially textured character inspired by the comics of Joseph Michael Linsner.
For more information and to see what inspired Dawn, please visit http://www.linsner.com  
If you do visit this link please note I am not accountable for any information/visual
images on that site.  Adult content is included.

There are two esps included:

 	"Playable Dawn and Equipment" adds a new race with one head and hair style,
with a custom body (permanent underwear).  Playable Dawn is set up as her own race.
	
	**Please note that when you first select  the race it will be set to 
male and nothing will show in the character selection screen.  Simply changing the sex will 
show you the face and hair selection.

The race is set up almost exactly like the Imperial race...Only Dawn has her own powers.
on touch).  And yes, she has a head should the need to become a vampire happen.

The body mesh has been updated to Better Bodies 2.1.  However, Better Bodies 2.1 is not 
required to use this mod.  All files used from BB 2.1 have been modified and renamed.

There are 4 sets of armors that fit Better Bodies 2.1.  Each set of armor is set up only
as cuirass and boots, however you will notice in game some cuirasses have wings, necklaces,
or pauldrens.  These have been set up this way to make changing the companion's outfits 
easier.   The companion is NOT included in this esp.

The armors,rose and thorn sheild that wraps up the right wrist, and new sword can be found
in Caldera, Hodlismod's shop.  They are expensive.  The armors can ONLY be found here in the
"Playable Dawn and Equipment" esp. Warning- they are expensive.

	"Dawn Companion" adds a companion to Suran, Desele's House of Earthly Delights....she
can be found upstairs.  The playable race is NOT added to this plugin.  The armor can be 
found in the chest next to Dawn.  Her sheild and sword are on her person.

DAWN COMPANION USES GRUMPY'S COMPANION PROJECT V 1.3 SCRIPTS PLEASE READ IT!!If you want to
know what the companion can do you will HAVE TO READ GRUMPY'S READ ME!!!!

All item IDs and script names have been renamed to avoid conflicting with other 
companion mods that use the same scripts. Dawn the companion also is a different custom race
(this one not playable) to avoid conflict with "Playable Dawn and Equipment".

Dawn should be fine as a companion vampire as well.

Both esps,"Playable Dawn and Equipment" and "Playable Dawn" should be 100% compatable
with one another.


Requires Morrowind and Tribunal.  

***Copyright info***

NO stoy lines or concepts from the Dawn comics and/or background was incorporated 
into this mod.

Dawn and her concept and image are property of Joseph Michael Linsner.  The face is only
an inspiration, and is not an exact copy of the face.  The body art and outfits are not a
direct replica of any of Dawn's existing outfits....however, they have been inspired by a few.

2.  Installation

 Extracting the files directly into your Morrowind directory should do the trick.
   But if not:
    
     - The meshes folder "KO_Dawn" should be placed in your 
          "Program Files/Bethesda Softworks/Morrowind/DataFiles/Meshes" directory

     - The textures should be placed directly into your 
           "Program Files/Bethesda Softworks/Morrowind/DataFiles/Textures" directory

     -  The esps should be placed loosely in your
	   "Program Files/Bethesda Softworks/Morrowind/DataFiles" directory

     -  The icons folder "Ko_Dawn" should be placed in your
           "Program Files/Bethesda Softworks/Morrowind/DataFiles/Icons" directory

     -  This read me you can do what you please with.  

Make sure you enable the mod(s) in the Morrowind Launcher before playing.

IF YOU HAVE THE ESPS: "Dawn Prefabricated Char v 2.esp" or "Dawn Prefabricated Char.esp" 
PLEASE DELETE THEM OR DO NOT USE THEM.

3. Changing your prexisting character into Dawn.

Yes it is possible.  Please note this may cause problems with your game...make sure you
backup your saves and SAVE YOUR GAME BEFORE YOU TRY THIS.

Open up the console by hitting the ~ key and type in "enableracemenu"
This will open up a menu to change your race, hair, face, etc. 
Changing your race can cause some temporary issues, however reloading most of the
time will solve them.
