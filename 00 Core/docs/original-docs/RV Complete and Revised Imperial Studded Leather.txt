This mod adds the remaining parts of the imperial studded leather armor into the game.
You can find the parts in the generic armor leveled lists.

UPDATE: I have decided to rework this mod and give the pieces a minor make over, I also added an optional chest piece with a longer skirt.



all pieces are made by me and are free to use as a resource by anyone who wishes as long as you credit me for it.

If i have made some kind of mistake please let me know and i will try to fix it as soon as i can.

you can keep up to date with me and my workings by following me on this terrible website
