this mod is a remake of the TR dreugh armor, I also included a slightly altered version of the helmet improved uvs as well as a new chest piece with a sash with fixed uvs on the belt. (I included a version with just the uvs without the sash if you don't like it)

As of Version 1.2 this mod now includes an esp that places the new armor pieces in the vanilla leveled lists.

If my presentation here feels lazier than usual it's because i don't really like dreugh armor, it looks like crusty dried up bubble gum, but some one had to do it so here we are.

If I have made some kind of mistake or bug or what have you, please let me know, otherwise enjoy.
