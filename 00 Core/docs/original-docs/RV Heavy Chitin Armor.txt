Heavy Chitin Armor

Whilst usually used to make light armor, chitin plates are occasionally layered to create heavy armor.

You can find this armor in leveled loot lists, it's stronger than dwemer but weaker than ebony.

If I've made a mistake or you have any suggestions please let me know.

This mod was made with resources from the community and as such please feel free to use this armor in your own mods or edit it as you want.

update 1.01 : added missing first person hands mesh
update 1.05: improved uvs and rigging, also added new boots ground model
update 1.2: slightly improved models for the boots and also removed dirty GMSTs (sorry that was sloppy of me)
update 1.5: new models for boots and greaves (the old ones were basically retextures), also slightly improved helm and chest mesh.

Thanks to:
Danke for parts of the chest
Niero for the scarf
Tyermala for pointing out the missing mesh
and special thanks to Leyawynn for helping me with a variety of things and taking the screenshots
