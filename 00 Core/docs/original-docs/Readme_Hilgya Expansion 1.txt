===============
1. DESCRIPTION
===============

Adds 17 new outfits, most in multiple colors, to Hilgya's shop in Dagon Fel. There is a total of 87 new articles of clothing, counting all the colors.

===============
2. Requirements
===============

Better Bodies (else the clothing will look VERY strange!)
Hilgya the Seamstress.esm (For a place the clothes are sold)

========================
3. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN
========================

Unzip the archive labeled "Other" Morrowind/Data Files directory and the texture archives to Morrowind/Data Files/Textures. All archives are needed. The .esp should go in Data Files, the .dds files should go in Textures/Pl, .nif files should go in Meshes/Pl, and .tga files should go in icons/Plangkye.

=====================
4. PLAYING THE PLUGIN
=====================

From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files and check the box next to the
Hilgya the Seamstress Expansion 1.esp. Be sure Hilgya the Seamstress.esm is checked too, otherwise this mod will not work. The clothes are for sale in Hilgya's store in Dagon Fel.

===============
5. SAVE GAMES
===============

This mod should not have any effect on save games, though it's always a good idea to clean a save with Wrye Mash when installing/uninstalling mods.

============================
6. CONFLICTS / KNOWN ERRORS
============================

Vanilla pants that were modified in Better Clothes clip with the closer-fitting male coats and shirts. This problem only happens with the segmented Better Clothes, so the pants introduced in this mod (and other non-segmented pants) should work without clipping.

================================
7. CREDITS / PERMISSIONS RECEIVED
================================

Thanks to:
NioLiv, Robearberbil, and the Better Clothes team for the models
Elthar for her leather resource pack
Meriko of Gaia Online for the design of the Konami Shojou dress
CeJeu for the design of the desert clothing 

==========================
8. CONTACT AND INFORMATION
==========================

I can be reached on the Bethesda Softworks forums under the username of Plangkye. If for any reason you cannot contact me there, you may email me at hplockhart@verizon.net.

=========================
9. LEGAL STUFF/ DISCLAIMER
=========================

You are free to use these clothes in your own mod, as long as you give me proper credit in the readme.
