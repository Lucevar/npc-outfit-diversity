    INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************
Manual Installation:

This mod is packaged/archived with 7zip.  Should one desire to use
this mod, an archive programme such as 7zip, Winrar, Winace, or 
Zip Genious should be used to extract/open the information/files herein.
(Although, if you are reading this, then you already know how to do 
extract from archived files, so good for you :) ).

Once extracted/opened, just drag and drop the Data Files Folder into 
the Morrowind folder in your C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\ 
directory and they will go where they are meant to go (except the 
README). All thefiles are placed inside folders as marked (become 
familiar with manual installations, your game will thank you for it). 
You will then be prompted to overwrite.  Click yes/ok and the files 
should now be properly installed.

    ABOUT THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

This mod is a pre-release of many of the items to be featured
in the EFCR clothing replacer mod (more info here on that...
http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1096207-wipz-efcr-clothing-replaceradditions-thread-2/

This mod, itself, seeks to make these items available for players
to make use in game by adding a vendor, Liria, to Verara Rendo's 
Clothing Shop in Suran.  She sells all the new items for all of 
one's one-stop shopping needs.

In addition to obtaining the articles from Liria, most of the 
clothing items have also been placed in leveled lists so that 
they will appear randomly in containers and other vendors that 
one would encounter while adventuring.  

*****************************************************************

     Save Games

*****************************************************************

This basic version of the mod should not conflict with any new save, 
lest one has another mod that alters Verara Rendo's shop specifically
(but then this mod should still be compatible with such as nothing 
existing has been altered, as only new content has been added).


*****************************************************************

      Issues/Bugs/Mild Irritances

*****************************************************************
-Most of the textures in the mod are in large format (1024x1024)
and many of the articles of clothing use multiples of these large 
textures. As such, there may be a slight performance hit on older
machines (just a heads up)

-Some of the "Robes" have an "Instant Outfit" quality to them
(meaning that they are set up as a robe but might look like a 
Tunic+Trouser combo).  These were designed as such intentionally
(but they may be split up in a future update should any desire 
to mix and match these items as shirts and trousers individually).

-Some of the clothing items use alpha channels (the layer in the texture 
that makes certain bits of a mesh transparent through use 
of texture specified areas).  As such, under certain conditions, 
the clothing might function awkwardly (like flickering when 
overlapped with another alpha enabled mesh, or disappearing when 
spells like "Invisibility" or "Chameleon" are cast on the player 
(though once the spell is ended, the clothuing should return to normal).  
This true of many other mods, not just this one (so no worries, enh)?

-The items in this mod were designed with the Better Bodies mod 
in mind.  As such, some of the clothing make use of the seemingly
unconventional body slot assignments so as to make use of alpha 
channels (exposing the body mesh underneath).  These articles might
not be compatible with items that take up the "vanilla" style body 
parts (so just a heads up there as to the possible clipping or 
seemingly missing body part when one of these items is worn with 
a more conventional item).  

-When accessing Liria's mercantile inventory, there may be a slight
delay.  No worries as this is due to the large amount of items that
she has to sell and the window will open eventually (and subsequent 
visits will result in the barter window opening even faster).

-This is, in essence, a v1.0 of the mod in that I plan on updating
this with a v1.1/patch version that will add the clothing items
to the appropriate levelled lists (so that these can also be obtained
from casual adventuring, rather than shopping for them)

-"reserved for future input on things that, at present, may not 
be readily apparent"

-A Leveled List Merger is reccommended to be sure that the items will
appear properly in the containers/barter menus throughout Vvardenfell.

Thank you PsychoDog Studios for BB and BC
Thank you BHL for doing some extra cleaning on the .esp
Thank you NifTools for NifSkope
Thank you to the community for the continuing support.
Thank you to AlienSlof for initally pointing me down the 
right paths when I first began making mods.

Permissions = The modded items in this mod are OK to use, but not
necessarily a true "resource" (as I mod with players in mind, so implementing them 
into a new mod might take some extra doing, but not impossible). Do not re-upload or 
redistribute this as it is in this archive.  If you would like to use this in 
a mod separate from this given mod, then please make sure that the appropriate
credits are acknowledged and that I am notified so as to assist you if necessary:D.
If any changes are made to textures or meshes, then rename them so as to 
not conflict with the original textures/meshes.  I ask, though, that these not
be included in a mod compilation or an overall NPC clothing replacer (as 
the latter is something that I am working on by utilising these items 
in this mod specifically).  I also ask that the items that correspond 
to the MLSND and BRZ Folders and their respective textures not be used, 
as they are going in two other additional mods and would like to keep them 
unique to this and those mods to keep them "special" (whatever that means, 
so thanks ;) ). The MLSND and BRZ meshes are OK to use, just not with the 
given textures :) .
