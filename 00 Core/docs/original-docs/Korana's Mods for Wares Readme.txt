Description
____________

Edits to Clothiers of Vvardenfell:

My edits:
------------

Armour from level 1 and up

Please refer to the original mods' readme (included) to know who to credit.
Make sure you credit everyone and link to the original mods

_____________
Installation
_____________
I have made 2 separate plugins: One with Clothiers of Vvardenfell exclusively, the other, with every other mod.
You may select either or both.

WAIT! I liked the shops! Can I have them? 
Sure, install the original mods first
Install this mods second (you will overwrite original, non-optimised textures)
Load this mod last (so the rebalanced/renamed items stay balanced and renamed)
