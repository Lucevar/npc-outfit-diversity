==============================================
REQUIREMENTS:
==============================================
Morrowind (of course!)
It will work best with, and is designed for Better Bodies 2.2. Clipping may occur on other body types.

It is otherwise entirely stand-alone and doesn't require my other shop, though it's designed to compliment the stuff in the other one.

==============================================
ABOUT THIS MOD:
===============================================
There are so many female clothing mods out there, but very few for the guys, so I decided to do a few things for them, since my world really revolves around males. I can't compete with the excellent female clothing modders (I don't have much sense of female fashion, despite being female!), so I'm sticking to stuff I like to see men in! I will probably do clothing and armour variations of the same outfits so they can be mixed and matched. I did these primarily for myself and my vampire character Basil, so most of the armoured stuff will be light and it's mostly goth stuff.

I've made the stuff in the shop unstealable just as in my first shop - customers can see what's on offer but can't pick it up. Vampires don't like being stolen from!

It's probably not lore-friendly, so please don't whine at me about it. I make mods for myself first, so I make what I want in my game to suit my own characters and my tastes. I'm getting tired of people complaining about lore, and I've reached the point where I just say 'stuff it' now! 

New in this shop:

A selection of several new armours, all in light, medium and heavy versions with increasing amounts of coverage depending on weight.
Dozens of new long hair wigs in different combinations of 2 colours.
New colours of several popular items.
Large range of classical gentlemen's clothing.
Some more kinky stuff!
Werewolf fur winter-wear
A selection of vampire-related tapestries that the player can hang up at home. 

===============================================
INSTALLATION:
===============================================
This mod should consist of:
GothShopII.txt
Slof's Goth Shop II.esp
icons folder
meshes folder
textures folder

Just drag all these (minus the readme) onto the data files folder in your Morrowind directory and they will go where they are meant to. All the files are nested inside sub-folders marked 'AS' - KEEP THESE INTACT - the game knows to look there for them.

Paths for the folders are as follows:
Icons: data files/icons/AS
Meshes: data files/meshes/AS
Textures: data files/textures/AS

===============================================
KNOWN ISSUES OR BUGS:
===============================================
There might be some minor clipping and some shirts probably won't work with Bethesda boots due to how the body slots are used for BB clothing. Some alpha-channelled clothing will disappear underwater if viewed from above. This is to do with the alpha-channels and nothing much I can do about that! The easy solution is: take your clothes off to go swimming! ;)

There is also some slight clipping at the top of the leg on the pants that show parts of the leg through. Again, this is a mesh issue and I can't avoid that. Best just to ignore it unless I can find a newer mesh or get it fixed. All of this stuff is male only, apart from the spider outfit which is unisex - some of it can be worn by females, especially accessories, but none of it is of a feminine shape and some items will cause major clipping on a woman - bits of her would stick out in very strange places!

There will be a certain amount of experimentation with mixing and matching clothes; some things work together and some don't. This is down to the way I've had to use body slots. I've done my best to make most things work together.

Sometimes the mannequin heads spin when you enter the shop. I've never figured out why they do this, it's just one of those odd little things!

I've made some of the clothing very enchantable, including alpha-channelled items - to avoid the transparent areas looking weird with the plastic-wrap effect, I recommend a mod such as 'No-Glo' that removes this effect.

Note about the backpacks: They are labelled 'Leg' or Neck' - the leg versions use the left upper leg slot and the neck ones use the neck slot. I've included both types to allow more freedom to mix'n'match with other clothing items. They are otherwise identical. They have a fairly large amount of feather scripted to them, making them useful as well as looking good.

These textures are very large, and may cause a framerate hit on lower-end computers. I could have made them smaller, but at the sacrifice of quality. I went for quality. :)

===============================================
INCOMPATIBILITIES & SAVED GAME WARNINGS:
===============================================
Always make sure that you back up your existing savegame file before use.

There are no known incompatabilities that I know of, apart from the Bethesda boots thing - it's just a basic clothing mod.

This has been cleaned with TESAME

I don't really mind if any of this is used for or in other mods, but it's nice to be asked (I don't often say no!), and please give credit to me and the mesh-makers where it is due. Make sure to change any filenames and ID's to avoid accidental overwrites. Please ask me before uploading it anywhere so I can make sure the correct version is used and not an out of date one.
