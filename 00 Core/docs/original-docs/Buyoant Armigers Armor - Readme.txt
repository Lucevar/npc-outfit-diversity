1. DESCRIPTION
===============
This mod adds new armor set designed specifically for the Buoyant Armigers. According to the lore they are supposed to be Vivec's chosen companions and champions (like Almalexia's Hands), but they don't even have their own iconic armor set. So I decided to give them one. In the original game they wear light armor, either chitin or glass. Judging from their skills they are mobile warriors who specify on quick and stealthy raids into enemy territory. However the glass armor doesn't particularly fit this concept: though it is the best light armor in game, it is also the brightest - not the best characteristic for a stealthy warrior. And the chitin armor is very cheap, with low armor rating - not suitable for an elite warrior, handpicked by Vivec himself.
I wanted to give Buoyant Armigers something in-between, something that is practical to wear during raids inside the Ghostfence. The new armor looks like chitin reinforced by glass, with cloth parts that won't let ash and sand inside the armor joins during ashstorms. Icons of the Temple saints provide spiritual protection.

There are two ESPs, use only one of them: 

- BuyoantArmigersArmor_NPC.ESP gives new armor to the Buyoant Armigers NPCs (not to all but to many). You can buy it from Dronos Hlervu in Ghostgate, Tower of Dusk or go to Tureynulal and search for a dead buoyant armiger.

- BuyoantArmigersArmor_Resource.ESP only adds the new armor in CS.
