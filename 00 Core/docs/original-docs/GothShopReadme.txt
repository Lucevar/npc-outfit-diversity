REQUIREMENTS:
==============================================
This mod requires just basic Morrowind, as it only adds new clothing. It will work best with, and is designed for Better Bodies 2.2. Clipping may occur on other body types.


==============================================
ABOUT THIS MOD:
===============================================
There are so many female clothing mods out there, but very few for the guys, so I decided to do a few things for them, since my world really revolves around males. I can't compete with the excellent female clothing modders (I don't have much sense of female fashion, despite being female!), so I'm sticking to stuff I like to see men in! I will probably do clothing and armour variations of the same outfits so they can be mixed and matched. I did these primarily for myself and my vampire character Basil, so most of the armoured stuff will be light and it's all goth stuff.

Just on the northern outskirts of Vos, a reclusive pale-skinned altmer by the name of Mr Lee has opened a little shop that caters for gentlemen of a darker persuasion. Named after his pet guar, Nigel, The Black Guar sells a large range of goth style clothing for men only, from fetish-wear to stylish trenchcoats. Mr Lee also sells an exclusive range of snakeskin separates that mix'n'match. He also has a selection of paintings in two sizes, all of my vampire characters and a few shiny knick-knacks for sale. As the enigmatic Mr Lee is a vampire catering specifically for vampires, it makes sense that he only opens at night; the shop is closed during the day and the lock is unpickable. Despite his vampirism, he is happy to sell to any customers, mortal or vampire - he doesn't even care what clan the vampiric customer is. Money is money, after all!

I've made the stuff in the shop unstealable - customers can see what he has on offer but can't pick it up. The only way to steal from him is to get through into his back room - no easy task either! If he catches you trying to pick his door lock, prepare to be drained dry!

===============================================
INSTALLATION:
===============================================
This mod should consist of:
GothShopReadme.txt
Slof's Goth Shop.esp
icons folder
meshes folder
textures folder

Just drag all these (minus the readme) onto the data files folder in your Morrowind directory and they will go where they are meant to. All the files are nested inside folders marked 'AS' - KEEP THESE INTACT - the game knows to look there for them.

===============================================
KNOWN ISSUES OR BUGS:
===============================================
There might be some minor clipping and shirts probably won't work with Bethesda boots due to how the body slots are used for BB clothing. Some alpha-channelled clothing will disappear underwater if viewed from above. This is to do with the alpha-channels and nothing much I can do about that! The easy solution is: take your clothes off to go swimming! ;)

There is also some slight clipping at the top of the leg on the pants that show parts of the leg through. Again, this is a mesh issue and I can't avoid that. Best just to ignore it unless I can find a newer mesh or get it fixed. All of this stuff is male only - some of it can be worn by females, but none of it is of a feminine shape and some items will cause major clipping on a woman - bits of her would stick out in very strange places!

These textures are very large, and may cause a framerate hit on lower-end computers. I could have made them smaller, but at the sacrifice of quality. I went for quality. :)

===============================================
INCOMPATIBILITIES & SAVED GAME WARNINGS:
===============================================
Always make sure that you back up your existing savegame file before use.

There are no known incompatabilities that I know of, apart from the Bethesda boots thing - it's just a basic clothing mod.

This has been cleaned with TESAME

I don't really mind if any of this is used for or in other mods, but it's nice to be asked (I don't often say no!), and please give credit to me and the mesh-makers where it is due. Please ask me before uploading it anywhere so I can make sure the correct version is used and not an out of date one.
