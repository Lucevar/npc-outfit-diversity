So, the netch adamantium armour is an old classic. Changes in this version

- Added the armor to leveled lists and to some NPCs
- Removed unique head for Cythus
- Removed fake quiver: we have weapon sheathing now
- Removed helmet: looks too much like the standard adamantium helmet: way too fancy
- Moved Cythus to Molag Mar Waistworks as I thought it was a better spot for a seasoned warrior (the Halfway tavern in Pelagiad is already crowded enough with AM and F&F).
- Added a few lines of unique dialogue to Cythus, he'll tell you about his background and the netch adamantium armor
