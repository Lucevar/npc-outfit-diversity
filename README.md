# npc-outfit-diversity
Distributes community assets to various NPCs. My personal alternative to Vanilla Friendly Wearables Expansion. 

Philosophy: Balanced around making sure NPC outfits look good/appropriate rather than worrying about balance (ie there will be lots of NPCs wearing nearly full sets), on the assumption that the player isn't a complete murder-hobo.  

This is, in general, not a wise assumption, but I made this mod for myself first and foremost, and I don't generally kill NPCs unless a quest tells me to.  

Besides, my thinking is that NPCs who get armor upgrades will also be harder to kill, so it balances out reasonably well.  

In some cases, where the armor/gold values from the original mods are egregiously out of line with vanilla, I'll nerf them.
