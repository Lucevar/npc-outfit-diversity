# npc-outfit-diversity
Distributes community assets to various NPCs. My personal alternative to Vanilla Friendly Wearables Expansion. 

Philosophy: Balanced around making sure NPC outfits look good/appropriate rather than worrying about balance (ie there will be lots of NPCs wearing nearly full sets), on the assumption that the player isn't a complete murder-hobo.  

This is, in general, not a wise assumption, but I made this mod for myself first and foremost, and I don't generally kill NPCs unless a quest tells me to.  

Besides, my thinking is that NPCs who get armor upgrades will also be harder to kill, so it balances out reasonably well.  

In some cases, where the armor/gold values from the original mods are egregiously out of line with vanilla, I'll nerf them.  

I largely leave generic guards alone so you can use your guard mods of choice.  

Differences with vanilla friendly wearables expansion: 
* Doesn't include item replacers
* Not dependent on BCOM
* Fewer new NPCs (not none)
* Fewer scripts

## Features
* Edits approx 700 out of 2675 total NPCs in vanilla Morrowind (+ expansions).
* Many NPCs have received outfit upgrades with unique or rare armours: look out for names like Vedam Dren, Bolvyn Venim, Gothren, Orvas Dren, and more
* Many bandits and Hlaalu nobles now have heads more fitting to them, using resources from TD - thanks to Rogues Gallery and Hlaalu Noble Facial Overhaul
* Noble Dunmer have a much greater variety of exquisite robes to choose from, as well as hair worthy of their status in life - thanks to Dunmer Noble Overhaul. Additionally, upgrades the outfits of many nobles that DNO skipped.
* TD and OAAB variants of iron and steel armor have been widely distributed. 
* Khajiit and Argonians also have much more diverse heads and hairs thanks to More Argonian Heads and Dim's Khajiit Head & Hair pack

* Fishermen, miners, and farmers now often carry signs of their trade - baskets, nets, scythes, egg miner masks, and so on
* Buoyant Armigers are now distinguished by their unique chitin-glass blended armours, while the Ordinators are clothed according to the Orders to which they belong

* Many Bretons now wield rapiers, especially spellswords who previously had spells but no swords.
* Some Breton males also get new hairs from 
* Almost all the master trainers now have new outfits, some of them unique to them. All master trainers are now non-hostile by default. Adds Cinia Urtius to the game.
* NPCs in stormy or ash-ridden environments now often have hoods, hats, or other protective gear.
* Ashlanders and mabrigashs also get gear upgrades
* Many other armours and weapons created by modders have been distributed to NPCs
* Iconic NPCs are mostly left alone. Don't worry, Caius is safe from shirts.
* Items are also available in levelled lists and, in a few cases, placed in cells.

Mostly, no. The exceptions are the mods below, which CAN be run with NOD, and may offer additional features:
