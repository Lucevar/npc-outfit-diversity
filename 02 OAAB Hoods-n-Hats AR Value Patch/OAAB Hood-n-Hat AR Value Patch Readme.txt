OAAB Hood-n-Hat Armor Value Patch 
v1.0
================================
Big name for a small mod.

Increases the armor rating value of OAAB's hoods and hats to 20, so that even NPCs with decent Unarmored skill will wear their headgear. Mages are the worst for refusing to wear a hood because they achieved the dizzying heights of like... 30 unarmored skill. 

It's possibly slightly OP, especially in the early game, but any advantage the player gets is balanced out by the slight added difficulty of opponents wearing hoods so... eh. #FashionFirst

Permissions:
This mod is so small I can't imagine anyone will ever want to do much to it, but go wild. Release a patch, include it in your mod, do whatever. I just tweaked some numbers.

Have fun out there!
