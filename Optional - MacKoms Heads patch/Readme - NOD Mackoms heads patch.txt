The default version of NOD uses meshes for Dunmer Nobles Overhaul that have been patched to work with vanilla/Westly's head meshes (ie, they have ears attached to the hair, instead of the head mesh like in MacKoms).

This patch just restores the original meshes from DNO. 

Credits:
ivolga/Aoimhevelho for creating the meshes in the first place
MacKom for their appearance overhauls
TaiyakaJ for suggesting that I include this patch
